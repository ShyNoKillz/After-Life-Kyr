			<h2>Hear it</h2>
			<p>I faced challenges while bringing my idea to life, but I didn't give up. I brainstormed different sentences for my character and the AI in the hangar, recorded them in Audacity, and experimented with various effects to achieve the desired result. I organized the sounds and focused on placement, equalization, and a long list of effects to create a unique experience. I even created my own effects by manually retouching mono tracks split into stereo tracks. Finally, I created background music using GarageBand with a retro 70/80's, 8-bit video game feel that would serve as an introduction to the "movie." The intro scene would then follow with credits like "produced by..." and "directed by" along with the name of the project.</p>
