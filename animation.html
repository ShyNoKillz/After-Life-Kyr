			<h2>NEXT STEP</h2>
			<p>As time passed, my character's story evolved. From AfterLife to the physical world, Kyr transformed into an android. Originally, I had planned to use Procreate and Photoshop to animate the character, but I decided to take a different approach. I used Illustrator to vectorize my frames and incorporated them into AfterEffects as assets. To convey the shift from virtual to physical, I chose neutral colors and a black background. Timing played a crucial role in the animation as I aimed to replicate the movement of a mechanical arm on an assembly line. The most challenging part was animating the character's eyes, but with patience and several YouTube tutorials, I finally achieved the desired result.</p>
