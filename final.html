			<h2>FINAL PROJECT STATEMENT</h2>
			<p>Throughout the creative and technical process of my final project, titled "AFTER 'DRAW'," I aimed to explore the power of imagination and the concept of limitless possibilities. The artistic inspiration for this project stemmed from the world of animation and alternate realities, which heavily influenced my character design and the overall story. To make the project my own, I utilized various software tools and techniques. I employed Photoshop for rotoscoping myself, meticulously tracing and animating my character, Kyr, frame by frame. Procreate was used for both stop motion and the “auto-drawing” door sequence, allowing me to bring different elements to life with a hands-on approach. After Effects played a crucial role in creating the transition where the door opens to a new world, incorporating the door from Procreate, which I vectorized, and motion graphics to enhance the otherworldly atmosphere. Finally, I utilized Premiere Pro to add sound and bring the entire project together. The format of the final project is an animated short video encompassing various animation techniques. From my initial storyboard conception to the finished product, there were some changes and refinements along the way. As I worked through the technical challenges and explored different media techniques, the project evolved to fully convey the sense of wonder and boundless imagination I had envisioned. In "AFTER 'DRAW',” the video follows another journey of my character continuing his search for “Trauma” doors. This time, Kyr has discovered a door that can only be found by drawing it on paper. Upon opening the door, a new world is revealed. This transformation showcases the power of creativity and the idea that anything is possible in the "AfterLife." While the project may not be perfect, I poured my efforts into utilizing the available software tools to my fullest potential, pushing my creative boundaries and learning along the way.
