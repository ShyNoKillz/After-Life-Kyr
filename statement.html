			<h2>Statement</h2>
			<p>This assignment in MMP100 has been the most challenging one I have encountered this semester. HTML can be complicated, and creating an aesthetically pleasing design requires multiple hours of work, which I have invested. I faced various difficulties throughout the process, particularly when it came to integrating my P5 sketch into a specific section in the HTML code. However, with the help of several YouTube videos and the resources provided in class and on Blackboard, I was able to overcome these challenges. Although I encountered some issues with centering the sketch, I eventually managed to do so. I am confident that my website is user-friendly and I hope youâ€™ll have a great time on my website!</p>
